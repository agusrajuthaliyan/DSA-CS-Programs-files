# C Programming DSA Practice
This repository contains various C programming files for my first semester Data Structures and Algorithms using C programming paper.

# Structure:

The code is organized into folders based on different programming concepts:

- `1D-Array`: Files related to One-Dimensional Arrays
- `2D-array`: Files related to Two-Dimensional Arrays
- `Basic`: Files containing basic C programming concepts
- `functions`: Files demonstrating the use of functions
- `pointer`: Files exploring the use of pointers
- `strings`: Files working with strings manipulation
- `struct`: Files implementing structures
- `Stack` : C files using stack Data Structure
- `Queue` : Queue Datastructure programs
- `Search & Sort` : Some search and sort Algorithms
